# KIBU RAHISI(SIMPLER KIBABII)
##### This repository contains my Third year university project.<br> 
* Kibu is a short form of Kibabii University while Rahisi is a kiswahili name meaning simpler. <br>
* Therefore Kibu Rahisi as the title of my project means creating a simpler Kibabii Universty comrades' life.<br>
* Its about developing a mobile application that will leverage current technology to assist class representative in the university <br>
to schedule classes online with ease.
This helps solve the problem of moving up and down the academic block looking<br>
for empty classes in order to schedule classes there. <br>
The app uses notifications to alert all users when a class is scheduled. <br>
