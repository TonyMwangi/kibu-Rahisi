# KIBU RAHISI(SIMPLER KIBABII)
##### This repository contains my Third year university project.<br><br> 
* Kibu is a short form of Kibabii University while Rahisi is a kiswahili name meaning simpler. <br><br>
* Therefore Kibu Rahisi as the title of my project means creating a simpler Kibabii Universty comrades' life.<br><br>
* Its about developing a mobile application that will leverage current technology to assist class representative in the university <br>
 to schedule classes online with ease. <br><br>
* This helps solve the problem of moving up and down the academic block looking<br>
for empty classes in order to schedule classes there. <br><br>
* A class has its detail and status and can only be allocated onces. <br><br>
* A lecture expires as per the lecture lenghth which is set during its scheduling. <br><br>
* Before a lecture expires it notifies the lecturer and the class representative 10 minutes before and both of them <br>
 have the rights to extend the class. <br><br>
* The app uses notifications to alert all users when a class is scheduled.<br><br>
* The app also contains Kibabii University facilities on a google maps plus other additional features <br>
thus can be used for orientation of the of the first years.<br><br>
* The app will be implemented in modules where the first module implement the academic block facility usage.
